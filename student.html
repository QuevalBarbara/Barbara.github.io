    <h1>Hey, I'm Barbara! </h1>
    <h2>Software engineer</h2>
    <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom: 2em;"> My dad was an engineer in France and always told us to do software engineering. But like any teenagers, my brother and I didn’t listen to him. My idea was to teach biology. 

But then the global pandemic hit, and had a big impact on me. I decided to get out of my comfort zone. I went to work as an Au Pair in the USA. It was an amazing experience, but it made me realize I was ready to move on from being a science teacher.

After lots of research, I became interested in Software Engineering. I could see that there were so many opportunities to build and create new things. As a teacher you might teach the same topic every single year of your life. But in Software Engineering the possibilities feel endless. It offers the freedom to choose, to specialize, to try new things, to create entirely new niches.

So in late 2022, I enrolled in a 10 month coding bootcamp with the MIT xPro program, and I graduated with their “Professional Certificate in Coding” in August 2023. It was a really fun and intense year, where I learned a lot of new skills:
- Building, testing, and deploying web applications and APIs
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines
- And using repositories like GitHub: https://github.com/QuevalBarbara
 		 	 	 		
I love practicing my new skills (https://www.codewars.com/users/QuevalBarbara) and putting my brain to work. Solving coding problems is something that I find super fun. Breaking down the problems, reasoning about the constraints, and finding the best solutions, it’s so much more satisfying than anything I have ever done before.

I am really excited for the opportunity to leverage my new skills to collaborate with a team, and build toward common goals together. I love the idea of bouncing ideas off colleagues and learning from them, learning everyday, and evolving in this constantly changing field. It is such a unique profession. And I hope to make my dad proud, and offer him the opportunity to tell me “ I told you so!”.	</p>
